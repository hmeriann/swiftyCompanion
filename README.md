The idea of this application is to search for information about student of the 42 Network by his nickname using 42 API.

## My app can:
- Signs in using OAuth 2.0
- Shows preview of the found peers with their profiles pictures in a green contour, in case the user is active, also shows the status of the peer (student, alumni or some else)
- Shows peer's details which are profile picture, full name, email, pool year, the level and all the cursus skills with values in the sections and all the projects peer did or in progress with.
- It is possible to go back to the first view
- The project uses Auto Layout.

## The short demo:
